# Custom CKEditor skin #
This skin is based on the default [Moono-Lisa](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/moono-lisa) skin. It is optimized for using CKEditor vertically by using the CSS flexbox layout structure. Additionally, the CKEditor button colors are modified to better fit the SlideWiki design. 

## Building ##

When changing the source code in `./moono-lisa-custom-source/`, use the [CKEditor building tools](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_build.html) to build the skin. After building, overwrite the skin files in `./moono-lisa-custom-build/` with your own version.
